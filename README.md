# convert-directory
Changes portions of a file name across an entire directory
This python3 project reads a directory, and replaces a certain part of every file's text within the directory. The user can choose what text is changed and what it is changed to.
As an example, if you have a directory with 5 files named apollo1.txt, apollo2.txt, apollo3.txt, apollo4.txt, apollo5.txt, you can replace "apollo" with "gemeni" in every file name
Before I began learning python, I had to perform this task over 1000 files. The inspiration for me writing this code came from the want to avoid this repetitive task.
